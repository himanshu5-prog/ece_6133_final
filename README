Following are the files/directory description:

1) dfs.sh : Script to execute placement in depth-first search partitioning in various mode of operation

2) bfs.sh : Script to execute placement in breadth-first search partitioning in various modes of operation

3) logfile: This directory contains logfile generated by the code. Naming convention : $circuit_$mode_$dfs/$bfs.rpt
   For example: industry3_2_bfs.rpt is generated by industry3 circuit in mode 2 with bfs partitioning

4) input: This directory contains hgr and dim file which is used as input for placement. All hgr and dim files should be in this directory.

5) output: This directory contains csv file which contains coordinates of each cell along with its width.
	The format of csv file is: x-coordinate of left-bottom corner,y-coordinate of left-bottom corner,width of cell

6) src: This directory contains C++ files. min_cut.cpp is the top-level file. Code is written in C++.

7) run_all.sh : This script run placement with all modes and configurations. Internally, it source bfs.sh and dfs.sh

8) sample_script.sh: This script can be used to run any other circuit. Make sure, hgr and dim files are copied to input directory. 
   Change the hgr and dim file in sample_script.sh

9) makefile: 	Use 'make all' for compilation.
		Use 'make clear' to clear output, logfile directory and executable file: min_cut.out
		Use 'make help' to get information about argument list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Running placement on existing circuits in input directory

#To clear old executable, logfile and output file
make clear

#To run placement using BFS partitioning
source bfs.sh

#To run placement using DFS partitioning
source dfs.sh

## Alternatively run_all.sh can be sourced to run placement using both bfs and dfs partitioning

##Logfile is generated in logfile directory. Search "ECE6133" in logfile to find important parameters like wirelength, run-time, aspect-ratio.
## cell coordinates and wire coordinate is generated in output directory

				Running placement on new circuits

1) Copy hgr file and dim file of circuit to input directory

2) Edit sample_script.sh and change the corresponding variable for hgr and dim file. 

3)Use 'source sample_script.sh' to run placement
